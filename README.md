# Art Kids

**A Supplemental Art Education Program**

## About

Art Kids is a supplemental art program designed to help advance art education in school systems. Following the successful model of Drama Kids, Art Kids aims to provide the extra support and instruction needed to fill critical gaps in arts education.

## The Problem

Unfortunately, drama, music, and art are not sufficiently funded in many school systems. While Drama Kids has succeeded in providing the extra support needed in that area, there remains a significant gap in art instruction:

- **In Alabama, 55% of schools receive little to no art instruction**
- Students across the state experience vastly different levels of art education
- Some schools provide art instruction weekly, while others offer none at all
- This creates an educational equity gap between students

## Our Mission

Art Kids is designed to provide consistent, quality art instruction to bridge this gap. We aim to ensure that all students, regardless of their school's funding situation, have access to meaningful art education that:

- Develops creative thinking and problem-solving skills
- Enhances visual literacy and cultural awareness
- Builds confidence and self-expression
- Complements and extends beyond the standard curriculum

## How It Works

Art Kids provides supplemental art programming to schools that lack adequate art instruction. Our program:

1. **Supplements existing curriculum** - We work alongside schools to provide additional art instruction time
2. **Serves underserved communities** - Priority is given to schools with little or no current art programming
3. **Delivers quality instruction** - Professional art educators provide age-appropriate, engaging lessons
4. **Maintains consistency** - Regular programming ensures students receive continuous art education

Art Kids is a supplemental art program designed to help advance art in a school system. This is an opportunity to advance the Arts outside of the normal curriculum. Unfortunately drama, music and art are not sufficiently funded. Drama kids has succeeded in providing the extra amount needed in that area. Art Kids is designed to provide the same level of art instruction. In Alabama 55% of schools get little to no art instruction, while some get art weekly leaving a big gap in instruction time between different art students. Art Kids is structured to expose students to a variety of mediums and advanced techniques. This is for the students that show an interest or talent in art. Having additional instruction will allow our students to compete with other schools. While teaching at my studio in Columbus, my students won several state and national awards entering through Muscogee county schools. I want to take the some phoenix city students to that same level. Art teaches hand eye coordiantion, spatial recognition, probelm solving skills, decision making skills, critical thinking and the ability to accept constructive criticism. In Alabama 90% of the highest testing schools have high access to art while 93% of the lowest scoreing schools have little to no art. Art Kids will be parent funded and comparable in price and operation to Drama Kids. Classes would be held at various schools that would benefit as a fundraiser as well. A percentage of all fees will be donated to the host school. Classes will meet weekly from 3:30 to 4:30. Please contact Art Kids at 706-573-0073 or anartlesson@gmail.com

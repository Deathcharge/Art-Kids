Art Kids is a supplemental art program designed to help advance art education in school systems. This is an opportunity to advance the Arts outside of the normal curriculum. Unfortunately, drama, music, and art are not sufficiently funded. Drama Kids has succeeded in providing the extra support needed in that area. Art Kids is designed to provide the same level of art instruction.

In Alabama, 55% of schools get little to no art instruction, while some receive art weekly, leaving a big gap in instruction time between different art students.

Art Kids is structured to expose students to a variety of mediums and advanced techniques. This program is for students that show an interest or talent in art. Having additional instruction will allow our students to compete with other schools. While teaching at my studio in Columbus, my students won several state and national awards entering through Muscogee County schools. I want to take some Phenix City students to that same level.

Art teaches hand-eye coordination, spatial recognition, problem-solving skills, decision-making skills, critical thinking, and the ability to accept constructive criticism. In Alabama, 90% of the highest-testing schools have high access to art, while 93% of the lowest-scoring schools have little to no art.

Art Kids will be parent-funded and comparable in price and operation to Drama Kids. Classes would be held at various schools that would benefit as a fundraiser as well. A percentage of all fees will be donated to the host school. Classes will meet weekly from 3:30 to 4:30.

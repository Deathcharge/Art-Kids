# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## About Art Kids

### What is Art Kids?

Art Kids is a supplemental art education program designed to provide quality art instruction to schools that have little or no existing art programming. Following the successful model of Drama Kids, we work to close the gap in arts education.

### Why is Art Kids needed?

In Alabama, 55% of schools receive little to no art instruction. This creates an educational equity issue where some students get weekly art classes while others have none. Art Kids provides consistent, quality art education to underserved schools.

### How is Art Kids different from Drama Kids?

While Drama Kids successfully addresses gaps in drama education, visual arts require specialized instruction, materials, and curriculum. Art Kids focuses specifically on visual arts education including drawing, painting, sculpture, and other art forms.

Art Kids was created in response to the critical shortage of art instruction in school systems, inspired by the success of Drama Kids in supplementing drama education.

# Funding and Resources

## The Need for Funding

Art Kids exists because arts education is chronically underfunded in many school systems. While essential for well-rounded education, drama, music, and art often face budget cuts when schools experience financial constraints.

### The Funding Gap

- **55% of Alabama schools** receive little to no art instruction
- Arts programs are often the first cut during budget shortfalls
- Schools serving low-income communities are disproportionately affected
- The inequality in arts access creates educational equity issues

## Art Kids Funding Model

Art Kids uses a sustainable, diversified funding approach to ensure program stability and growth:

### 1. School and District Partnerships

**Partnership Contributions:**
- Some schools pay a portion of program costs based on their ability
- In-kind support (space, materials, coordination time)
- Integration with existing school budgets when possible

**Sliding Scale:**
- Schools with resources contribute more
- Under-resourced schools pay reduced rates or receive free programming
- No student is denied access due to school's inability to pay

### 2. Grant Funding

**Target Sources:**
- Arts education grants (state and federal)
- Education equity grants
- Youth development grants
- Community foundation grants
- Corporate foundation grants

**Focus Areas:**
- Direct program delivery

### 3. Individual Donations

**Donation Levels:**

**Impact:**
Every donation directly supports student access to art education. Contributions are tax-deductible to the extent allowed by law.
